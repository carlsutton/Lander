ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = carat, y = price)) + geom_point()
# sae basics off ggplot object to a variable
g <- ggplot(diamonds, aes( x = carat, y = price))
#  plot carat versus the color of the diamonds
#  by placing the color inside aes, the data determines the color and creates a legend
g + geom_point(aes(color = color))
#  facet wrap sorts the data, in this case by color, and plots them separately
g + geom_point(aes(color = color)) + facet_wrap(~color)
#  facet grid is simillar, but breaks it down further by additional variables
#  the plot below shows plots for each color levels by each clarity level
g + geom_point(aes(color = color)) + facet_grid(cut ~ clarity)
#   one can also do a histogram with facet wrap which is revealing in itself
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = carat)) + geom_histogram(aes(color = color)) + facet_wrap(~color)
