# Lander Chp 7 Statisical Graphs
# load the lubridate package from Hadley Wickham
require(lubridate)
require(ggplot2)
# create year and month variables
economics$year <- year(economics$date)
# the label arguments to month means that the result should be the
#  names of the months instead of the number
economics$month <- month(economics$date, label = TRUE)
#  subset the data
#  The "which" function returns the indices of observations where the
#  tested condition was TRUE
econ2000 <- economics[which(economics$year >= 2000), ]
#  Load the scales package for better axes formatting
require(scales)
#  Build the foundation of the plot
g <- ggplot(econ2000, aes(x = month, y = pop))
#  add lines color coded and grouped by year
#  The group aesthetic breaks the data into separate groups
g <- g +geom_line(aes(color = factor(year), group = year))
#  Name the legend "Year"
g <- g+ scale_color_discrete(name = "Year")
#  Format the y axis
g <- g + scale_y_continuous(labels = comma)
#  Add a title and axix labels
g <- g + labs(title = "Population Growth", x = "Month", y = "Population")
#  Plot the graph
g
#  It works
